# CRUD PROJECT
## Events Application
The application I have been creating performs the actions of the requirements, Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD). As a small introduction to my application, users will be able to first specify the type of event they would like to host alongside their budget and additionally display an image so the decoration company can help tailor to their requests. Users will then be required to fill in additonal information including the option to have catering porvided and a space for them to give us a detailed description into the services they require.

**Event Type**

- ID
- Occasion Name
- Budget
- Picture URL *(inspo pictures)*
- Cake Size

**Decor Details**

- ID
- Guest Capacity
- Description
- Alcohol
- Catering
- Cuisine

Using a Trello board helped me visualise the process clearly and keep track of workflow against the time limit.



Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): shows the relationship of entities stored in a database. The cardinality type between the two tables would be one to one. There is one relationship between the event type and d√©cor details since only one occasion per order can have a service. Additionally, the specifications such as theme/cake design and cuisine will be tailored for that one specific event. We would not be able to provide for a birthday and a wedding unless the two occasions are processed separately.
